## Getting Started

The simulation interface consists of three main components:

1. **Control Panel**: Contains buttons to navigate through different ambiguous grammars and derivation steps
2. **Derivation Panels**: Left and right panels showing two different derivations of the same string
3. **Parse Tree Visualization**: Side-by-side comparison of parse trees demonstrating ambiguity

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Selecting an Ambiguous Grammar

Click the **"Change Grammar"** button to cycle through three different ambiguous grammar examples. Each grammar demonstrates a specific type of ambiguity commonly found in programming languages.

### 2. Understanding the Interface

- **Input String**: Displayed at the center, showing the string being derived by both parse trees
- **Production Rules**: Listed below the input string, showing all available grammar rules
- **Derivation A & B**: Left and right panels showing two different derivations of the same string
- **Parse Trees**: Visual representations updating as you step through derivations

### 3. Stepping Through Derivations

#### Auto Step Mode

Click the **"Auto Step"** button to automatically advance through both derivations simultaneously. The simulation alternates between the left and right derivations, showing how the same string can be derived differently.

#### Manual Navigation

- **"Previous Step"**: Go back one step in the current derivation
- **"Show Hint"**: Get guidance about the next step or the difference between derivations

### 4. Observing the Derivation Process

As you step through the derivations:

- **Derivation Steps**: Watch how each panel shows different sequences of rule applications
- **Parse Tree Growth**: Observe how the trees develop differently for the same input string
- **Rule Applications**: Notice which production rules are applied at each step

### 5. Comparing Parse Trees

After completing both derivations:

- **Structure Differences**: Compare the final tree structures side-by-side
- **Semantic Implications**: Understand how different parse trees can lead to different interpretations
- **Ambiguity Visualization**: See clearly how one string has multiple valid parse trees

### 6. Exploring Different Grammar Types

The simulation includes three types of ambiguous grammars:

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Demonstrates operator precedence ambiguity
- **String Concatenation**: Shows grouping ambiguity in sequence operations  
- **If-Then-Else Statements**: Illustrates the classic dangling else problem

### 7. Understanding Results

A successful exploration involves:

- Completing both derivations for the same input string
- Observing the structural differences between the resulting parse trees
- Understanding why the grammar is considered ambiguous
- Recognizing the practical implications of each type of ambiguity
