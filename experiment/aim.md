### Aim of the experiment

To demonstrate and understand ambiguity in Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) by:

1. **Visualizing multiple derivations** for the same input string using different ambiguous grammars
2. **Comparing different parse trees** that can be generated from ambiguous grammars
3. **Understanding the concept of leftmost derivations** and how they can differ for the same string
4. **Exploring practical examples** of ambiguity including arithmetic expressions, string concatenation, and the classic if-then-else problem
5. **Analyzing the implications** of ambiguity in compiler design and programming language parsing
